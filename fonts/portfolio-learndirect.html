					<h3>The Manufacturing Institute</h3>
					<p>The Manufacturing Institute are the UK's largest manufacturing charity, with a remit to support and improve the manufacturing sector through training, education and consultancy. They wanted to restructure their website and update the way their offer is presented online across all digital channels, to reflect the manufacturing journey from classroom to boardroom.

I met with and interviewed key internal stakeholders, from the CEO to the training and sales teams, to establish business objectives and goals for the new site. I attended site visits and met with service users to understand their very different sets of needs and requirements for the new site.</p>
      <p>A new information architecture was developed, bringing five separate product areas and microsites into a single space. A series of wireframes reflected core functionality and content areas. The site includes a comprehensive tagging system, and an aggregation of the institute's social feeds from a single hashtag onto a dedicated page, to encourage discussion around manufacturing and increase engagement.</p>
      <p>Development was split into phases, and prioritised with the product owner and senior team at the Manufacturing Institute. A website promoting an international conference hosted by the Institute was launched first. The conference site included a complex event booking system, speaker biographies, venue details and location map. The site was designed to amalgamate into the main website once development was complete.</p>
