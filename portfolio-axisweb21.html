          <h2>Axisweb21 Campaign</h2>
          <p>Axisweb21 was designed as a campaign piece to promote 21 years of contemporary arts organisation <a href="http://www.axisweb.org/" target="_blank">Axisweb</a>. I led on the development of an interactive feature, designed to be easily shareable across social media and to keep visitors engaged on the site.</p>
          <h3>Social engagement</h3>
<p>I sourced and commissioned digital agency <a href="http://www.enjoy-digital.co.uk/" target="_blank">Enjoy Digital</a> to produce the  feature, working closely with their product managers, designers, and developers, and internal teams  at Axisweb to  ensure the project ran on time and met the brief.  The feature was supported by a social media campaign,  which pointed users  towards the page and culminated with a Twitter party at Axisweb HQ.</p>
