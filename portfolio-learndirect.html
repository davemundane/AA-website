          <h2>learndirect 'Nothing Can Stop You' campaign</h2>
          <p>Post 16 education providers <a href="http://www.learndirect.co.uk/" target="_blank">Ufi/learndirect</a>, developed a campaign to break down barriers to learning and to change perceptions around adult education.</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.collectivelondon.com/#home" target="_blank">London creative agency Collective,</a> were commissioned to produce a microsite, which provided an engaging, interactive platform to promote the campaign. Working with the web  services and marketing teams, I developed a series of animated and  static promotional campaign materials, used on internal and external  sites. I adopted the same illustrative, hand-made style from the  microsite creative to provide consistency across all media.</p>
