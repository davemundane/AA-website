          <h2>St Luke's Hospice lottery microsite</h2>
          <p>St. Luke's Hospice wanted to introduce a new online lottery, to raise money for the charity, and promote how the people of Sheffield were being helped by the organisation. I worked closely with the client, to establish a responsive framework and content for a lottery microsite, to link from the charity's corporate site.
          <h3>If you stay local you can play local</h3>
          I worked with the communications team at St. Luke's to undertstand their brand, establish the audience, and develop typical journeys from a range of entry points through to purchase. I created wireframes using Moqups outlining core functionality and page components for each key section.</p><br>

          <p>I managed a small, in-house project team to design and build the site, and I worked with colleagues and the client to make sure the development was on schedule and built to a high standard.</p>
